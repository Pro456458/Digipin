# Digipin
The Department of Posts has undertaken an initiative to establish a Digital Public Infrastructure (DPI) for a standardized, geo-coded addressing system in India.
As a part of this initiative, The Department has finalised DIGIPIN – the foundation layer of the DPI. This initiative seeks to provide simplified addressing solutions for seamless delivery of public and private services and to enable “Address as a Service” (AaaS) across the country. DIGIPIN is an open-source national level addressing grid developed by Department of Posts in collaboration with IIT Hyderabad and NRSC, ISRO and is a key component of the digital address ecosystem. The advent of DIGIPIN will mark a revolutionary step in India's journey towards digital transformation by bridging the crucial gap between physical locations and their digital representation.
